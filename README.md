## Project Title : Student Attendance Tracking & Rewards Platform(pointwise)

**Project Overview**:
This project involves creating a website or mobile application to monitor and track student attendance effectively. Beyond basic tracking, the app incentivizes consistent attendance by allowing students to earn reward points. These points can be redeemed for various rewards, coupons, or exclusive access to events. The primary goal is to enhance attendance rates and student engagement by implementing a reward-based attendance system.

### Key Features

1. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Each teacher will share a unique attendance code in their class session.
   - This code is time-sensitive and can only be accessed within a specified location radius to ensure genuine attendance.

2. **Reward System**:
   - Students who attend classes regularly can earn points by claiming the attendance code.
   - After claiming points, they are added to the studentâ€™s account, reflecting both attendance and points earned.

3. **Redemption of Points**:
   - Points accumulated can be used in the app's store to access rewards or buy tickets for events.
   - The reward options could include discounts, vouchers, and passes for school or college events.

4. **Enhanced Engagement**:
   - This app serves as both a tracking tool and a motivational system, encouraging students to participate actively in classes.
   - Additional features might include personalized attendance reports and notifications about events where points can be redeemed.

### Workflow

1. **Initiating Attendance**:
   - At the beginning of each class, the teacher shares a unique code with students.
   - This code remains accessible only within a certain GPS radius, ensuring students are physically present in the vicinity.

2. **Claiming Points**:
   - After the class, students enter the code to confirm their attendance, adding points to their account.
   - Points reflect their attendance consistency and can be tracked in the app.

3. **Using Points**:
   - Students can view their points balance in the app and browse available rewards.
   - Rewards include items and event tickets, redeemable directly in the app.

### Future Enhancements

- **Personalized Analytics**: Custom attendance reports to help students track their progress.
- **Event Integration**: Collaboration with local businesses or school events to offer exclusive rewards.
- **Gamification**: Introducing badges and levels to further encourage participation.
